# Welcome to my personal page

## Short bio and research interest:

Banawe is currently a Ph.D. Candidate in Development Economics at Wageningen University and Research. Previously, from February 2011 to February 2014, he was Postdoctoral Fellow at CSIRO (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization) at the Mathematics, Informatics, and Statistics Division, now Computational Informatics, in the Risk Analytics Group in Clayton, Victoria, Australia. He obtained his Ph.D. in Statistics in June 2010, and Masters Degree in Mathematical Engineering (Area of Statistical Sciences) in 2006, Bsc. in Statistical Sciences (2004) and Bsc. in Business Administration and Management (2002) from the University Carlos III de Madrid, Spain.

My primary research interests are non-parametric smoothing methods in general with applications in Biostatistics, Environmental Modelling, Epidemiology, Mortality and Times Series Analysis. Mainly, I'm studying smoothing techniques based on penalized splines regression models (Penalized Likelihood splines with low-rank B-splines basis) in mixed effects and additive models framework ("Generalized Linear Mixed Models," GLMM's) for multidimensional problems such as spatial and spatiotemporal modeling. Currently, I am also working on Health-Related Quality of Life data modeling and composite link models. I am also interested in complex data modeling, Big Data applications, computational statistics and Data Visualization.
